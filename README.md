# Image Inpainting
This web app is to show an Image Inpainting model. Image Inpainting is an AI tool to erase certain objects from the image and "inpaint" or change it to the background image predicted by the AI.

# Dataset
Subset of the Places365 dataset (from kaggle): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mittalshubham/images256

# Some disclaimers
- If you want to run it locally, it needs to be run in Python 3.12 (it will not work on Python 3.13). I haven't tested it using Python below 3.12.
